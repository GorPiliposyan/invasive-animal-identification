# Invasive Animal Identification Project

![Project Banner](https://github.com/GorPiliposyan/invasive-animals/blob/main/banner_img.png)

This project aims to determine whether an animal captured in an image is classified as an invasive non-native (alien) species within specific regions of the United Kingdom. The full information from the UK government is provided [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/invasive-non-native-alien-animal-species-rules-in-england-and-wales). The current model specializes in distinguishing between invasive (non-native) terrapins and turtles compared to native species. Utilizing YOLOv5, our computer vision model accurately identifies 17 distinct species through object detection with bounding boxes.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to create a computer vision solution for identifying invasive terrapin and turtle species. The YOLOv5-based model encompasses 17 species, leveraging object detection techniques with bounding boxes.

## Features

- **Species Identification**: Detects and identifies 17 invasive terrapin and turtle species.
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes bounding boxes for accurate identification within images.


## Usage

The project offers a [web application](https://terrapin-species-classifier.streamlit.app/) that serves as a user-friendly interface for public use. Provide guidance here on how users can access and utilize the application for species identification.

## License

This model is available for educational purposes. Users are encouraged to cite this repository if the model is utilized elsewhere.
